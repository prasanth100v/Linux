          🔸 date | tee -a log.txt

3️⃣ Save output to multiple files
          🔸 uname -a | tee file1.txt file2.txt

4️⃣ Capture output of a root command (very common)
          🔸 sudo dnf install nginx | tee install.log

⚠️ If the command needs sudo, tee may need it too:
          🔸 command | sudo tee /etc/config.conf  ➡️   echo "Hello" | sudo tee /etc/test.conf
```
